# Anatomy and Physiology App
 
This app was created from a branch of Handcraft. It includes many of the same simulations, and the learning platform. However, I will delete/reorder much of it to optimize this app and focus it for our A&P project that includes a 3-part curriclum for students: introduction to VR, Simulation 1 Skeleton, Simulation 2 Cardiovascular
